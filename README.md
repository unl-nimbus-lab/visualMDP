# visualMDP
This provides a set of functionalities to combine Matlab's grid world + a MDP solver to solve and visualize an optimal path for a MDP problem defined in a grid.

This lists the steps to create, solve and visualize a Markov Decision Process. This uses Matlab's Reinforcement library and a MDP Toolbox developed by Marie-Josee Cros. Link : https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/25786-markov-decision-processes-mdp-toolbox
